This app helps users understand how ventilation and other measures affect the indoors transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It estimates the risk of infection for a single individual exposed to a concentration of virus particles in the room, calculated based on the room size, ventilation rates, and other parameters set by the user. It is assumed that hands are washed and that individuals are far apart from each other â€” i.e. there is no risk of short-range transmission by droplets/aerosol.

The indicated risk should be treated with caution: it is useful for assessing the relative importance of mitigating measures such as reducing exposure time, increasing ventilation, or wearing a mask. The uncertainties in the background science are too high for an absolute quantification of risk. In an effort to keep this app relevant to address the COVID-19 pandemic, the calculation method will be constantly updated to keep up with the latest scientific findings.
